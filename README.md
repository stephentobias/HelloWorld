# Hello World
This repo is being used to follow most of the examples in [The Cherno's videos](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLlrATfBNZ98dudnM48yfGUldqGD0S4FFb) on youtube and some examples from [Learncpp.com](https://www.learncpp.com/). 

So far I'm still learning how to use github and Visual Studio so I'm not sure how to create multiple binaries in one repo. These exercises may span multiple until I get more familiar with my tools.
